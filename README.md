## Technologies Used

**React**  
**JavaScript (ES6+)**  
**CSS**

## How It Works

**The game board consists of a 3x3 grid, where two players take turns marking a square with either an "X" or an "O."**  
**The state of the game is stored in React, and the UI is updated based on the current game state.**  
**A player wins when they align three of their marks (X or O) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.**  
**If all squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.**
